# Conflicts

Conflicts describe rules for random combinations that you never want to appear together.

Conflicts can be described in many different ways. You might have a conflict between...

* Two Traits
* Two Values of the same Trait
* Two Values of two different Traits
* A Value of one Trait with ANY value of another Trait

Conflicts will not match if a Trait Value is _"None"._

{% hint style="info" %}
Conflict resolution affects the overall rarity of your Trait's Values. If two values are defined to have 50% likelihood, but one of those values can conflict with many other Traits, you can expect that its representation in the overall collection will be lower.
{% endhint %}

When a conflict arises, you can opt to have it resolved in one of the following ways:

* Set either Trait's Value to _"None"_
* Choose a new Value randomly for either Trait

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you opt to choose a new random value, be sure to have other options available. Treat Toolbox will only attempt resolution a fixed number of times before giving up.
{% endhint %}
