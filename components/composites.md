# Composites

Composites are the output of the generative process. After you `Generate New Composites`, you can review the composed artwork and metadata, and the resulting `Rarity Chart` for the Drop.

While reviewing, you can click on a Composite for additional options:

* **Delete**: you can delete individual Composites, but be aware, this will reduce your [Drop's](drops.md) total supply. (If you plan to curate your output in this way, it might be advantageous to compensate by generating a larger supply, and then deleting until you reach your original target.)
* **Add Additional Metadata**: you can more metadata on a one-by-one basis. (This might be useful if you want to designate a few NFTs as special in some way, for example.)&#x20;

When satisfied with the Composite set, you can proceed to `Export for Candy Machine`. This is the only time that a cost will be incurred if using the hosted version of Treat Toolbox. You will be prompted to provide payment before continuing.
