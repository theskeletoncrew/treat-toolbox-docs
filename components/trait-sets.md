# Trait Sets

Trait Sets are an _optional_ feature, that allow you to separate groups of [Traits](traits.md) to be mixed together when your NFTs are generated.&#x20;

If, for example, you are generating a PFP project, and you have two different characters being released in the same [Drop](drops.md), you might use trait sets to separate the Traits of each of the individual characters.

Trait Sets properties are defined below:

* **Name**: an internal-only name to help refer to this trait set
* **Supply**: the number of items in your drop that should be generated from this set. This must be less than or equal to your total [Drop](drops.md) supply,&#x20;
* **Metadata Title / Metadata Value**: up to 2 optional metadata properties you can define that will be added to every NFT generated as part of this set.
