# üç¨ What is Treat Toolbox?

{% hint style="info" %}
**Before you begin:** Treat Toolbox is provided as both an open-source utility and a hosted platform with more advanced features. The open-source version requires technical knowledge to get setup. See the [Github README](https://github.com/theskeletoncrew/treat-toolbox) for detailed steps to get started.

Treat Toolbox is a powerful utility that helps you create and manage NFT collections through a simple to use web interface.

With Treat Toolbox, you can upload artwork, define attributes and metadata, and generate thousands of NFTs ready to deploy to the blockchain. It was made to work seamlessly with Solana, using [Metaplex Candy Machine](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex), but could just as easily be leveraged for Ethereum NFT projects.
